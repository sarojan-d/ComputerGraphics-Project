# ComputerGraphics-Project
This C++ program demonstrates a classic bouncing DVD screensaver using the `graphics.h` library for computer graphics. 
The screensaver features a bouncing DVD logo that changes color upon hitting the screen boundaries.

## Usage
The DVD logo will bounce around the screen, changing color upon hitting the screen boundaries.
Press any key to exit the screensaver.

## Customization
You can customize the behavior of the screensaver by modifying the source code in the Bouncing DVD.cpp file.
Experiment with different speeds, and screen boundaries or shapes to create your own variation of the classic screensaver.

Note: The graphics.h library might not be available on all systems, and its usage is relatively outdated. Consider using modern graphics libraries and frameworks for more advanced and cross-platform graphics programming.
